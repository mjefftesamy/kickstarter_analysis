#Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
##### Analysis and Challenges
We will be analyzing different datas to find out how those project tend to be successful. 
First analysis will be based on the date the project was launched, different datas of several projects have been collected from 2009 to 2017.
It will be represent by a graph extract from a table that lays out what are the different outcomes of those datas.
Second analysis is based on the goal set by each project, we will study how the different project are likely to make their goal by comparing
their achievement to their outcome.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
After analyzing our data, it has been deducted that more Cinematic Project are release in theather between april and august. 
Project that come out during that period tends to be more successful as well. whereas between september and February seems to be a slow season 
as we tends to have less significant growth in launching cinematic project. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
According to our datas, we have find out the higher the goal is for a project the less likely it is for a project to be successful. there is
a significant decrease in the success of the projects based as much as the goal range tend to grow. more project tend to fail or be canceled
once the project goal range become greater.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
the date lauch and the deadline were presented as raw data. It had to be sorted.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Certain factors that could explain how the different datas are not taken into account. such as the age of the public, advertisement, etc...

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
